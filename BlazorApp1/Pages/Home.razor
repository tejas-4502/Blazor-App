            <h2>One-to-Many Relationship</h2>
            <p>
                In database design, a one-to-many relationship refers to the relationship between two entities
                where one entity (the "parent") can have many related entities (the "children"), but each child
                can only belong to one parent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our application supports one-to-many relationships, allowing you to model and manage complex data
                structures efficiently.
